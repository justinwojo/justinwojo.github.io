Xamarin is a cross-platform framework owned by Microsoft utilizing the C# coding language. Xamarin was originally created by the company that created Mono, but was purchased by Microsoft in 2016.

This framework allows you to write code that can run on both iOS and Android devices without having to duplicate logic in Java or Swift independently.
